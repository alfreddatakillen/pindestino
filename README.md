pindestino
==========

Pindestino is a linux distribution/image for Raspberry Pi, built on top of Raspbian.

At boot, Pindestino will:

1. Start any Node.js application that is on your USB device.
2. Start Iceweasel in fullscreen, kiosk mode style.
3. Direct Iceweasel to http://127.0.0.1/ (that is your Node.js app).
 
More features:
* Pindestino mounts your SD card and your USB as read-only, so the Raspberry can be unplugged without a proper shutdown.


Build image
-----------

make must run as root, since the build will loopback mount the image:

	# sudo make


Booting image in qemu
---------------------

	# qemu-system-arm -kernel kernel-qemu -cpu arm1176 -m 256 -M versatilepb -no-reboot -serial stdio -append "root=/dev/sda2 rootfstype=ext4 ro" -drive file=pindestino.img,index=1,readonly,media=disk


Write image to SD card
----------------------

Something like: (Make sure /dev/mmcblk0 is the correct device!)

	# sudo dd bs=4M if=pindestino.img of=/dev/mmcblk0
	# sudo sync


Prepare your USB drive
----------------------

At boot, Pindestino will search for a USB device with the files app/package.json and app/pindestino.conf. Both those files must exist. It will then change directory (cd) into the app directory, and execute npm start.

Any node js application depenencies must be in the app/node_modules directory. NOTE: Binary modules must be of the Raspberry Pi architecture.

Your node.js application must listen at port 80. Otherwise, X11 and Iceweasel will not start.


app/pindestino.conf
-------------------

The app/pindestino.conf should be on your USB stick, and it will set some configuration for your pindestino. It should be in YAML format. Example:

	wifi:
		network: MYWIFI
		password: secret
	usb: rw
	bootscript: ./autostart.sh

To set Wifi network name and password:

	wifi:
		network: MYWIFI
		passwork: secret

To mount your USB in read-write mode:

	usb: rw

To run a bootscript (before "npm start"). Note that it is relative to the USB's app directory. 

	bootscript: ./autostart.sh


How to build your binary npm dependencies using Pindestino
----------------------------------------------------------

Your app directory on your USB need all npm dependencies installed before booting. Binary dependencies must be compiled for the Raspberry Pi architecture. This is how you could do that:

1. Put your node app on the USB and define all your dependencies in package.json.
2. Add "usb: rw" in your app/pindestino.conf to make the USB writable.
3. Add "bootscript: ./install.sh" to your app/pindestino.conf, to run that bash script before Pindestino runs "npm start".
4. Create a app/install.sh file on your USB, and paste this into it: HOME="$(pwd)" NODE_JS_HOME="/opt/nodejs" PATH="$PATH:$NODE_JS_HOME/bin" npm install
5. Now boot Pindestino with this USB stick. It will install your dependencies and compile your binary dependencien to the Raspberry Pi architecture.
6. Now your dependencies are on the USB. You can now remove "usb: rw" and "bootscript: ./install.sh" from your app/pindestino.conf and delete the app/install.sh file.
7. Viola!

Also note: Some modules require symlinks to work on your USB. The FAT file system does not support symlinks, so you might have to format your USB to some linux filesystem, for example ext3.
